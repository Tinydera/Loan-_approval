# Loan_approval
In this project, I tackled a critical business challenge: processing loan applications efficiently and accurately using five different machine learning models.

# Introduction
Your bank has gotten a list of loans and donâ€™t have time to approve or reject them tomorrow. You decided to use various models including logistic regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to help you make that decision. Perform the analysis and also be ready to answer the following three questions to your boss tomorrow morning. The paper needs to be written in APA format and needs to be a minimum of 2 pages. Upload your markdown file as well. Any images that you want to use should be referenced in the appendix. Include responses to the following questions in your submission:

What were the three most significant variables?
Of those three, which had the most negative influence on loan acceptance?
What is the best KPI (recall, precision, F1-score, etc) to measure the performance of your models?
Summarize all the KPIs for each model in a table including the processing time for running the models.
Of those models, which one has the best performance according to your answer in Q3 and the processing time?
