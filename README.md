# Loan_approval
In this project, I tackled a critical business challenge: processing loan applications efficiently and accurately using five different machine learning models.

# Introduction
A bank has gotten a list of loans and donâ€™t have time to approve or reject them. I decided to use various models including logistic regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to help you make that decision. Perform the analysis and also answered some stakeholders questions:

* What were the three most significant variables?
* Of those three, which had the most negative influence on loan acceptance?
* What is the best KPI (recall, precision, F1-score, etc) to measure the performance of your models?
* Summarize all the KPIs for each model in a table including the processing time for running the models.
* Of those models, which one has the best performance according to your answer in Q3 and the processing time?
